<h3 align="center">Created by IT Students at Western Nebraska Community College</h3>


## *INTRODUCTION*
- The Guild 2 Python Project is a python coding collaborative Team project for our Introduction to Computer Science course at Western Nebraska Community College.
- The project will demostrate the application of our programming and problem solving skills to create a functional and user-friendly system using python.
- Along with providing a practical application of the programming concepts learned during our course.

## *PROJECT OVERVIEW*
•	Project Name: [Guild 2 Bulk Fuel Management System]
•	Project Owners: [Richard Dobson][Jonathan Georgiades][Abbigail Rath]
•	Project Goal: [Provide a simplified interface for users to establish and track information related to a fuel   company’s customers, and their fuel tanks.]
•	Stakeholders: [Project Owners]

## *PROJECT BACKGROUND SCENARIO*
- A bulk fuel management logistics company requires a simplified and user-friendly GUI program that will incorporate customer information into a database.  The program must be able to check fuel status of the customer's fuel tank and generate an output of the the ten lowest fuel tanks, in order to alert the logistics company that the customer will require delivery of a new tank of fuel.

## *PROJECT PLAN*
The guild proposes the creation of a GUI bulk fuel management system program.  The program will incorporate a customer information database, from data derived from an input form; to create new objects.  It will take inputs manually (with an unimplemented plan for automatic API calls to a monitor vendor) for the percentage (%) of fuel remaining in a propane or diesel tank.  A “push button” will prompt a “check the status” of the tanks and generate an output of the ten lowest tanks for service/delivery.  The stretch goals for the project will be to involve other related information and/or services.  At a minimum, the goals of the project will be to display the following concepts:

I.	GUI interface (UX Design)
  1.	Main Window
    a.	Program title
    b.	Layout:
      i.	Menu Bar
      ii.	A  main display area, that shows fuel tank status, and “low” status alerts.
      iii.	An input form, that includes customer details
      iv.	Buttons; for checking status, adding/removing a customer, saving or loading a form.
  2.	Input Customer Data Form
    a.	Possible information fields will include:
      i.	Customer name
      ii.	Address
      iii.	Point of contact number
      iv.	Point of contact email
      v.	Fuel tank ID
      vi.	Fuel tank type; propane or diesel.
    b.	Validation fields to make sure that no invalid formats are used
  3.	Display Area for Status
    a.	Display to show the current fuel levels of a tank.
    b.	Display of which tanks need to be serviced; running low.
  4.	Alerts
    a.	Display messages for success or error notifications.
  5.	Design Responsiveness
    a.	GUI elements are adjusted to the proper window size.
  6.	Implementation Ideas and Notes
    a.	Use error handling and logging.
    b.	Use API that calls to monitor vendor.
    c.	Use data validation to ensure data integrity prior to processing any user inputs.
    d.	Utilize python libraries for numerical operations.
      i.	Examples: numpy, an open-source python library used for scientific computation.  Pandas, an open-source   library used in data science for data analysis, manipulation, and cleaning. 
    e.	Utilize python libraries for database creation.
      i.	Example: SQLite3, that integrates the SQLite database with python.
- In general, the purpose of this program will be to provide a simple interface for users to establish and track the information related to a fuel company's customers and their fuel tanks.
