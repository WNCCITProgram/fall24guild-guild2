"""
Generally speaking, the purpose of this program is to provide a simple interface to establish and track the information relating to a fuel company's customers and their tanks
A simple graphical interface, file writing/reading


# -----> Opening UX Decisions
# Establish GUI interface method
# Establish menu interface 
# Establish which method to write/read files, preference to a starter 'base' file of customer information for user to import
# that then can be edited at the local level


establish class constructor for "Customer" objects
# these object writers can write to a tuple, but should explore writing to a comma seperated value (CSV) file
    # when a new file is created, it will check the highest value of tracking number assigned to a customer, then assign highest value + 1 as the new number to the newest file
    # data needs to be validated where relevant (serial numbers are strings while tank volume is integer, etc)
    # --> Name, address, phone number, credit limit, current past due 
        # --> Validate formats for this information

establish either a sub object or a second object to describe the fuel tank
    # --> tank serial number, tank fuel type, tank size, tank make and year of production

# when a customer is tabbed through the GUI, it should list the customers in alphanumeric order, reference the tracking number, clear-repopulate the display with the customer data

stretch goals:
  A delivery planner to check for X number of lowest levels in tanks, and display them when a button is pressed 
  A means to simulate the passage of times affects on fuel levels by changing the days date in the program
